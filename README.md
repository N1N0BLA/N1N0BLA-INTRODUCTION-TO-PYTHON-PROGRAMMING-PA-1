LEARNINGS AND EXPERIENCES

1.) In order to figure out how to implement a string_sorter function, the first thing I did was to find out how to
transform a string into a list of symbols with the help of list(). In the beginning, I behaved as if everything will be
alright and began attempting to sort out the characters from the string without converting the string character
to an array. 
I also failed to replace the letters in the improper format to be put back into the string by the use of ‘.join() which left me with letters in forms of arrays only. 
These errors forced me to appreciate the need to learn about the data types and their conversions in Python.
Once I corrected those, I was amazed by how Python is so advanced in string sorting. 
That realization dawned on me when I observed how simply a built-in function, like sort() or join(), can perform a tedious task.

2.) In the modify function, I had a short realization that replacing the word Smile with a smile emoticon was present, as it only recognized the letter combination smile and not ‘Smile.’.
I had to shapeshift my inputs to lowercase since the capitalizations went hand in hand with the incapacity to work the replacements.
I also placed an additional space in between the words and the emoticons, which was not a pretty sight, so I had to be very keen with the join() function to prevent any additional spaces creeping in.
At any rate, these human errors aside, the major realization came when I noticed how smoothly Python word replacement features.

3.) Though I appreciated the power of Python's unpacking feature the most, especially in the third example where I attempted unpacking the list, 
I made a blunder in the beginning because I didn’t include the asterisk (*) before the middle variable. 
There was an error in this since Python could not comprehend what to do with the extra elements which were in the middle of the list. 
I also unbundled a short list in error and an error arose as there were not enough elements to fill "first", "middle", "last". 
These mistakes were useful since they made me think about the size of the list am unpacking. 
I realized the right thing after one entire code worked and I learned how Python managed to do that in such a short way.


Comments inside the code helps in simplifying and understanding how the lines of code work. 
First hand experience of using Python really makes C++ look tiresome due to writing several lines of code.
